                    The girl now walks past what seemed to have been an old concert hall, the impact of its grandness dulled
                    as it had been split perfectly in twain, as if some higher power had willed it so. Out of the tomb of sound
                    drift memories again: of dances, of performance, hopes, victories.

                    Her mouth twitches. Has it simply become boring, or is this something else? She lifts her hands and the
                    Arcaea come to her, gently weaving over her palms and through her fingers. Blankly she notes them. How
                    many times has she seen the last hurrah of a retiring band? How many times has she seen two brothers
                    embrace? Too many times she’s seen the formation of a love, so frequent it was apparently standard in old
                    and forgotten worlds.

                    She lets the memories go, and genuinely thinks nothing of it.

                    They rise. They fly to join with the memories she’s still been gathering, and she looks at their destination
                    now. It’s grown much brighter since she began her collecting. It seems to grow brighter every day...

                    How many days has it even been? She winces, and a grimace twists onto her face. She shakes it away.

                    Maybe she only needs more, then whatever is missing will be found. She calms herself and carries on, not
                    letting it bother her that no matter what, she cannot push the Arcaea following her away.

                <p class="conflictstory">Once upon a time, surely, things had to have been better.

                    The girl remembered nothing, and since awaking in the world of glass she'd only ever known other
                    memories. Because of this, she'd drawn many conclusions and had few second thoughts. She'd been
                    assured of the idea that nothing in the glass and nothing in this world held any worth. Filth and awfulness,
                    tears and pain, a small smile, and death.
                    
                    But once upon a time, things had to have been better. Simple rules are often true: shadows are begotten
                    from light. Shadow lurked at her back, and now she was surrounded by light.
                    
                    When she'd stepped into these waves of joy and purity, she hadn't given it a second thought. She'd become
                    so absorbed in evil that she had forgotten simple good. To be honest it was more than her heart simply
                    wavering, now. She was overwhelmed. For every glint of hope that caught her eye on the way to the jagged
                    maze, she paused and questioned everything. There was an answer she did not want to acknowledge,
                    immersed in this scene of light and chaos. She didn't want to think about it. She wouldn’t allow herself to
                    think about it.
                    
                    And, before she really could, she stood before the entrance to the impossible labyrinth.
                    
                    On impulse, she reached out to the better glass and memories of flowering fields came to follow around
                    her in a ring. She didn't know why, nor if they would help.
